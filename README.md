I am not aware of any specific cryptocurrency or coin called "apecoin". There are thousands of cryptocurrencies in circulation, and new ones are being created all the time. It's possible that "apecoin" is a name of a new or upcoming cryptocurrency project or a local cryptocurrency that is not well-known or widely used. Without additional information, it's difficult to provide a more accurate response.

Yuga Labs (the originator of BAYC) launched Apecoin on March 2022. The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is a collection of unique, digital collectible NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) that were created by the Bored Ape Club. The Bored Ape Club is a community of artists, designers, and crypto enthusiasts who create digital art that is sold as NFTs.

The Bored Ape Yacht Club consists of 10,000 unique Bored Ape NFTs, each with its own distinct look and personality. These NFTs have become highly valuable in the NFT market due to their rarity and unique design.

Membership in the Bored Ape Yacht Club comes with certain benefits, such as access to exclusive events and merchandise. Some members of the BAYC have formed a tight-knit community, with members collaborating on various projects and initiatives.

Overall, the Bored Ape Yacht Club is an example of how NFTs have enabled the creation of new forms of digital art and communities, and has become a significant player in the NFT market.
